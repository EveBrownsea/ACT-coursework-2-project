# ACT coursework 2 project
Repository containing files relevant to my coursework 2 project; project completed in python with a standard coding method and a neural-network method.

This project is using the dataset NuclearFusion_data, created by Adebusayo Adewunmi on Kaggle. 
The goal of the project is to create two methods for predicting whether or not a fusion process will undergo ignition, i.e. if it will become self-sustaining. For each input dataset, the output will be a 1 (Ignition) or a 0 (No ignition). 

**Download for dataset**:

- import kagglehub
- path = kagglehub.dataset_download("adebusayoadewunmi/nuclearfusion-data")
