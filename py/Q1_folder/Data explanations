# Data types and their links to scores.
This document explains each parameter in the dataset and how they will contribute to the overall score of a given run.

## Magnetic Field Fluctuation (T)
Magnitude of maximum fluctuation in the magnetic containment field. See Magnetic Field Strength for score details.

## Leakage (%)
% of plasma loss due to leakage. Inversely proportional to score.

## Percentage of Instabilities (%)
% of plasma that underwent instability. Inversely proportional to score.

## Magnetic Field Strength (T)
Strength of magnetic containment field. Score is related to the percentage value of magnetic field fluctuation over the total MFS.

## Magnetic Field Configuration
Use as a primary category.

## Injection Energy (MJ)
Energy of the injection beam used to heat the plasma. Add this to input energy when calculating the energy input/output score.

## Beam Symmetry (%)
Symmetry between injection beams. Unsure how this contributes to score.

## Target Density (m^-3)
Unsure.

## Target composition 
Type of fuel used in fusion reaction. Use as a secondary category.

## Fuel Density (m^-3)
Density of fuel. Unsure how this contributes to score.

## Temperature (Kelvin)
Temperature reached by the plasma. Positive correlation with score (??)

## Confinement time (Seconds)
Time during which plasma was successfully confined. Positive correlation with score.

## Energy Input (MJ)
Total energy used to initiate the fusion reaction.

## Power output (MW)
Total power produced by the fusion reaction. Multiply this by the confinement time to get energy output, then take the ratio 
of energy input and output; ratio is proportional to score.

## Pressure (Pa)
Pressure inside the plasma reaction chamber. Unsure how this contributes to score.

## Neutron yield (n/s)
Number of neutrons produced by the reaction per second. Unsure how this contributes to score.

## Ignition
Shows whether or not a plasma reaction became self-sustaining; 0 indicates no, 1 indicates yes. 1 will positively contribute
to score.
