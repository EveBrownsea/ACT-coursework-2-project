# Description
This folder contains the code for question 2. This code uses a neural-net approach to solving the problem.
The approach taken here consists entirely of neural-net code, rather than the traditional approaches taken in Q1.

**List of things to do:**
- [] Learn how neural-nets work and how to use them
- [] Try some methods and see what works
- [] Party
